# VLSI Physical-Design-Automation

## Introduction
This is a course on algorithms for VLSI physical design automation. Topics include partitioning, floorplanning, placement, routing, and other related issues. There are four programming assignments in the relevant chapters, and they are generally can be solved via the algorithms mentioned in the class, but it is not necessary to develop the same algorithm. I took this course in Fall 2020 and it was my first time entering the EDA field.

I enjoyed figuring out the better solutions for these NP-Hard problems and tried to improve the solution quality via randomization, parallelization, and some tricks in limited time resources during the time.
