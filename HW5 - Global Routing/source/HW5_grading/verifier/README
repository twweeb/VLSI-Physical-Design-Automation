Usage:
    ./verify <.modified.txt file> <.result file>

Output:
    If you can't see "...# RESULT #..." on the screen, your result file has wrong format.
    Otherwise, your result file satisfies our basic requirement.

    Make sure your result can satisfy the following constraint:
        1. # of unconnected net because of pin = 0
        2. # of unconnected net because of wire = 0
        3. # of net has duplicate wires = 0
    If you can't meet above constraint, your program fails on this testcase.
